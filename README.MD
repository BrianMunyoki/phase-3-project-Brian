# Student Management System (CLI Project)

A Python-based **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** application designed to manage students, courses, and enrollments efficiently.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **SQLite3**, and **CRUD operations**, built entirely without external ORM libraries.

##Project Overview

The **Student Management System** helps users:

- Add, view, update, and delete students.
- Manage courses and instructors.
- Enroll students in one or more courses.
- View which students are in each course.
- Store all data persistently using **SQLite3**.

Developed by **Brian Muema** as part of the Phase 3 Python Project.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- SQLite3 (built-in module)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Virtual Environment (`venv`)
